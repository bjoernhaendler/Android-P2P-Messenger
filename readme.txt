	        [  ]
		_____________________________________________________________________________________
		|>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>             How it works?	               <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<|
		|___________________________________________________________________________________|                  
		| First Activity  |     When the first activity is loaded we have to give  user's   |
		|	&	  |listening port first, which is known as start server from both   |
		| Chat Activity   |end. Other input initializes where our data will be send. So,    | 
		|		  |when everything goes okay connect button directs us to the chat  |
		|		  |activity where we can exchange all of our data with our peers.   |
		|		  |In Bottom left corner attachment alows us to send file and send  |
		|		  |voice messages.						    |						
		|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
		| Encryption key  |	Encryption key is needed to secure our exchanged data, you  |
		|		  |can give any integer value to it , but must be same for both. For|
		|		  |our data security we implemented Caesar Cipher encryption &      |
		|		  |decryption.							    |
		|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
		| send files      |	directs us to the storage to select a text file, and when we|
		|		  |click on the send button it opens the file, read it line by line |
		|		  |and send it just like a string message by doing Caesar Cipher    |
		|		  |encryption and On the other end when the user receives it with   |
		|		  |decryption. A code is added before sending the file so that other|
		|		  |end understood  that it is a file. Then from other end we create |
		|		  |a text file in android/data/eu.haendler.p2pmessenger/files and   |
		|		  |saves it line by line just like a simple text file.              |
		|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
		| voice button	  |	when voice button is clicked a popup wants some voice       |
		|		  |message from us   and set the best results over the "type your   |
		|		  |message here..." edit text. then we can send it just like other  |
		|		  |messages with propar encryption. 				    |
		|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
		| Save Chat       |	when save chat is clicked we open a dialog box to varify    |
		|		  |from user whether he really needs it or not. Once the user 	    |
		|		  |confirms, it calls writeToFile method where we created  a text   |
		|		  |file, write it line by line. Own messages are initialized with   |
		|		  |"ME" and other peer messages with "CLIENT".			    |
		|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
		|Change Background|	When Change Background is clicked we gave users one default |
		|		  |and nine more great background themes for beautify his chat box. |
		|		  |Once the user choose a layout, it sends a encrypted code to other|
		|		  |peer, change background for all and notify all the user using a  |
		|		  |message.							    |
		|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
		| Disconnect	  |	Here by disconnecting, a user can disconnect from his chat  |
		|		  |as his client and server socket get closed. Other user will still| 
		|		  |be connected to the port, can send messages but disconencted user|
		|		  |just can't receive it.					    |
		|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
		|Remove All Chat  |	Here this gives two functionalities one by removing all the |
		|		  |chat from own window, just remove all the views programatically  |
		|		  |and the other by  removing all the chat for both window.	    |
		|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
		|Reset Layout     |	Here by reseting layout, you can reset your layout(BG) as   |
		|		  |default for both window. just changed the background like others |
		|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
		|Voice Mode:      |	Specific commands are given as voice input when the mode is |
		|	ON/OFF	  |enabled. A new voice icon is added when the mode is enabled, you |
		|		  |can exchange messages also through this command		    |
		|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
		| Text Selection  |	We can select any text messages by on long press, can copy  |
		|		  |and paste to clipboard and share it to other application by 	    |
		|		  |implementing textAllSelectable.				    |

		|>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>              Why is it correct?               <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<|
		|___________________________________________________________________________________|
		|	We have implemented all the basic requirements that a network layer 	    |
		| messenger application should contain. We have added a bunch of extra features that|
		| is mentioned above.Used too simple logic and stored well documentation for	    | 
		| understanding what is going on through the whole code. We have implemented the    |
		| whole thing using java socket which is the foundation level requirements. The     |
		| program works so perfectly with the magical GUI. So we think our project is 	    |
		| correct.									    |
